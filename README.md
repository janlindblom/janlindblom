# Hello

Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jan, I'm a software engineer and tinkerer living on the Ã…land Islands.

I make stuff for fun or for your profit, build keyboards and do embedded
systems development in C and C++. I've done both huge monoliths in Java, slick
[12 Factor Web Apps](https://12factor.net/) in any mix of JavaScript, Ruby and
SQL.

I do a lot of translations into Swedish too, Mastodon and Tusky are my current
guilty pleasures, Microsoft MakeCode and Khan Academy before that as well as a
bunch of other projects during the years.
